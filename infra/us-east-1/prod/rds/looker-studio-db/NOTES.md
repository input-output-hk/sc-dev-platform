**NOTE**

This directory contains configuration used in synchronising the Looker Studio DB from the Marlowe Runtime DB.

The code is deployed daily from a cron job on the bastion host, so for the most part, this code can be said to be self-contained for the specific purpose of updating the Looker Studio DB.

There is not requirement for this to be run manually, but no harm in doing that either.
